    The terms also apply to any Microsoft:
    • updates,
    • supplements,
    • Internet-based services, and 
    • support services
    for this data, unless other terms accompany those items.  If so, those terms

    DO NOT USE THE DATA.
    
    If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.
    
    1.  SCOPE OF LICENSE.
        a.  You may use, modify, and create derivative works of the the Dataset:
             i.  for non-commercial or research purposes only. Examples of
                 non-commercial uses are teaching, academic research, public
                 demonstrations and personal experimentation; and
            ii.  to publish (or present papers or articles) on your results from
                 using such Dataset provided that no material portion of the
                 Dataset is included in any such publication or presentation.
    
    2.  DISTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS.  You may not: (a) distribute the Dataset;
        (b) alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the Dataset;
        (c) use Microsoft’s trademarks in a way that suggests your derivative
        works or modifications come from or are endorsed by Microsoft; or
        (d) include the Dataset in malicious, deceptive or unlawful programs.
    
    3.  OWNERSHIP.  Microsoft retains all right, title, and interest in and to
        any Dataset provided to you under this Agreement.  You acquire no interest
        in the Dataset you may receive under the terms of this Agreement.  
    
    4.  LICENSE TO MICROSOFT.  Microsoft is granted back, without any restrictions
        or limitations, a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free,
        assignable and sub-licensable license, to reproduce, publicly perform or
        display, use, modify, post, distribute, make and have made, sell and
        transfer your modifications to and/or derivative works of the Dataset,
        for any purpose.  
    
    5.  FEEDBACK.  If you give feedback about the Dataset to Microsoft, you give
        to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize
        your feedback in any way and for any purpose.  You also give to third
        parties, without charge, any patent rights needed for their products,
        technologies and services to use or interface with any specific parts of
        a Microsoft dataset or service that includes the feedback.  You will not
        give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to
        license its Dataset or documentation to third parties because we include
        your feedback in them.  These rights survive this Agreement.
    
    6.  TERM; TERMINATION.  The term of this Agreement will commence upon your
        acceptance of this Agreement and will continue indefinitely unless
        terminated earlier as provided herein.  If you breach this Agreement or
        if you sue anyone over patents that you think may apply to or read on the
        dataset or anyone's use of the dataset, this Agreement (and your license
        and rights obtained herein) terminate automatically.  If this agreement
        is terminated, you must return or destroy all full or partial copies of
        the Dataset in your possession immediately.  Any sections that are
        intended to survive termination of this Agreement shall survive.
    
    7.  EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.  The Dataset is subject to United States export laws
        and regulations.  You must comply with all domestic and international
        export laws and regulations that apply to the Dataset.  These laws
        include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use.  For
        additional information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting.
    
    8.  ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates,
        Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire
        agreement for the Dataset.
    
    9.  SUPPORT SERVICES.  Because this data is “as is,” we may not provide
        support services for it.
    
    10. APPLICABLE LAW.
        a.  United States.  If you acquired the software in the United States,
            Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and
            applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws
            principles.  The laws of the state where you live govern all other
            claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair
            competition laws, and in tort.
        b.  Outside the United States.  If you acquired the software in any other
            country, the laws of that country apply.
    
    11. LEGAL EFFECT.  This Agreement describes certain legal rights.  You may
        have other rights under the laws of your country.  You may also have
        rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the Dataset.
        This Agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country
        if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.
    
    12. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  The Dataset is licensed “as-is.”  You bear the
        risk of using it.  Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or
        conditions.  You may have additional consumer rights or statutory
        guarantees under your local laws which this agreement cannot change.
        To the extent permitted under your local laws, Microsoft excludes the
        implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose
        and non-infringement.
    
    13. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES.  YOU CAN RECOVER FROM
        MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00.  YOU
        CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS,
        SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
    
        This limitation applies to
        • anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on
          third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
        • claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or
          condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent
          permitted by applicable law.
    
        It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
        possibility of the damages.  The above limitation or exclusion may not
        apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or
        limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
